Prerequisite:
- Dezi 0.1.2 or higher
- Dezi PHP client 0.1.0 or higher

Steps necessary:
- Download Dezi PHP client
- Setting up Dezi

Download Solr PHP client
------------------------

This module uses an external PHP library for communicating with Dezi servers. Go
to [1] and download a supported version of the client.

[1] https://github.com/karpet/dezi-client-php

Afterwards, unpack this archive to drupal's libraries folder, so the directory
tree looks like this:

/path/to/drupal/sites/all/libraries/
  |- DeziClient
     |- Dezi_Client.php
     ...

The library should then be found by the module.

Setting up Dezi
---------------

In order for this module to work, you will first need to set up a Dezi server.
Download the latest stable version of Dezi
from [2] and unpack the archive somewhere outside of your web server's document
tree.

[2] https://github.com/karpet/Dezi

Follow the Dezi documentation to configure and start your Dezi server.

 % dezi &

Afterwards, go to [3] in your web browser to ensure Solr is running correctly.

[3] http://localhost:5000/

You can then enable this module and create a new server, using the "Dezi search"
service class. Enter the hostname, port and path corresponding to your Dezi
server in the appropriate fields. The default values already correspond to the
example application, so you won't have to change the values if you use that.
If you are using HTTP Authentication to protect your Dezi server (which is vital
for security on a production site) you also have to provide the appropriate user
and password here.
